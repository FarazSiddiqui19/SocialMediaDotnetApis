# SocialMediaDotnetApis

A **personal backend project** built to deeply understand **ASP.NET Core**,  
**Entity Framework Core**, **LINQ**, and the **Repository Pattern** by implementing  
a real-world style social media API.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The primary goals of this project are to:

- Learn **ASP.NET Core Web API** architecture
- Understand **Entity Framework Core** deeply
- Practice **LINQ queries** (simple to complex)
- Implement and refine the **Repository Pattern**
- Explore clean separation between:
  - Controllers
  - Services
  - Repositories
  - Data models
- Experiment with real-world backend decisions (trade-offs, refactors, improvements)

---

## 🧠 What I’m Practicing Here

- API design and routing
- DTO usage and mapping
- EF Core `DbContext` & migrations
- LINQ for filtering, grouping, projections
- Repository & Service layers
- Dependency Injection
- Async programming with `async/await`
- Refactoring code as understanding improves
